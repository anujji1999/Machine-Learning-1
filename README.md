## All the things you can do with Python :
1. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
2. Image Processing and Letter and Face Recognition.
3. Web Development Using Flask and Django
4. Data Analysis.
5. Data Visualization



## How to Setup Local Environment in your Machine for Machine Learning Projects

   1. Download Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download/#download .
      { 
        Select the latest Python  from the download section and also check your windows configuration (32 bit or 64 bit) and then download that
        version of Anaconda Graphical Installer.
      }
   
   2. Install the Graphical Installer and it will take some time to Install so wait and get a cup of coffe :p
   
   3. Now after complete installation now you need to configure your Anaconda:
    
     a. From Start Menu find Anaconda Prompt and open it. Wait for few minutes it will open in some time and start typing with
        i.   conda update conda 
        ii.  conda update jupyter
     b. Install all this packages
        conda install numpy
        conda install pandas
        conda install statsmodels
        conda install matplotlib
        conda install seaborn
        conda install scipy   
     c. If you want to search for any package in the Anaconda Prompt then "conda search scipy"
     
    4. To run :
       #To Open Jupyter notebook from Anaconda Prompt, type
         jupyter notebook

       #To Open Spyder from Anaconda Prompt, type
          start spyder
